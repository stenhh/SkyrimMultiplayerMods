===================================================

SkyUI 5.1+ is required to use this package.

These optional files will display your Warmth and Coverage on the bottom bar in the Inventory, Crafting, and Trade menus, as well as the Warmth and Coverage of every piece of gear.

To Install: Simply drop the contents of this archive into your Skyrim\Data directory, or use your Mod Manager.

When using a Mod Manager, ensure that this package loads AFTER SkyUI, or the changes will not take effect.
