===========   
Description   
=========== 

Winter Is Coming - Cloaks adds lore friendly only items into the world through the use of level lists and crafting, this will add more diversity to the game while keeping the "feel" of Skyrim. I was heavily inspired by Viking art and the HBO series Game of Thrones( A Song of Ice and Fire book series), none of the cloaks in the mod however are based on Game of Thrones simply inspired by.

Currently in game:

Bear Claw Cloaks: 9
Bear Hoods: 9
Armored Light Bear Hoods: 9
Armored Heavy Bear Hoods: 9

Wolf Skin Cloaks: 12
Wolf Skin Hoods: 15
Armored Light Wolf Skin Hoods: 15
Armored Heavy Wolf Skin Hoods: 15

All items work with all the races and genders, and can be bought, found or even crafted in game at the tanning rack and armored items can be tempered.

WIC is fully compatible with the mods Frostfall and Hypothermia.

==========   
Crafting 
========== 

To craft any of the items in WIC you MUST first have a new item called a Fur Crafting Kit, you can either craft the Fur Crafting Kit at the Tanning Rack or you can try and buy them from a merchant. Without a Fur Crafting Kit NO items will appear in the crafting menu, this is to help cut back on recipe clutter. When you are done crafting your cloaks or hoods, just store the Fur Crafting Kit someplace until your ready to craft more items.

Making a Fur Crafting Kit requires:
Tanning Rack
Basket (any) x 1
Leather x 1
Leather Strips x 1

=====================   
FAQ / Troubleshooting  
=====================

Q: Where do you get the items in game?
A: If you are using the Main version you can find all cloaks/hoods through out the world on enemy NPC, buy them in stores and craft them at the Tanning Rack.
A: If you are using the Craft Only version you may only craft them at the Tanning Rack.

Q: My game crashes at the main menu?
A: Crashes at the main menu normally mean your missing a master, please make sure you have the required version of Skyrim AND that any patches you might be using are correct.

Q: Why is there so much clipping with the cloaks?
A: Sadly there will always be clipping, I have done my very best to minimize clipping but there is only so much I can do. You will always have clipping with some weapons and items, you can remove most of the feet clipping by using a animation mod that tweaks the movement animations. Check the Suggested Mods section. I will NOT be rigging the cloaks to the feet, I HATE the way it looks and moves so please do NOT ask me to do so.

Q: How long does it take for the cloaks/hoods to show up in game?
A: About one week waiting will reset all NPC spawns that have already spawned, if you enter a new area that you have not been in before it should work right away.
 
Q: The items seem to show up to often or rarely?
A: I have tried my best to make all the cloaks and hoods uncommon on hostile NPC but not really rare.

Q: Will all NPCs have a cloak or hood on?
A. No, there is a small % that certain enemy NPC will have them on. Also guards in the colder holds have a % of wearing cloaks.

Q: Is this mod compatible with Frostfall, Hypothermia and Wet and Cold?
A: Yes, and you do not need a patch for any of them.

Q: Is this mod compatible with?
A. If the mod adds items to the same outfit/level lists then it will conflict, nothing game breaking will happen simply which ever mod is lower in the load order will show up on that NPC.

Q: Does this mod add cloaks or Storm cloaks/Imperials?
A: Not at this time. 

Q: Why are there three crafting recipes of the same cloak?
A: You installed all the .esp at once, you need to only have ONE main plugin at a time.

Q: What happened to the lorecraft versions?
A: It was no longer needed since I added the Fur Crafting Kit.

============   
Known Issues   
============ 

Clipping with some of the heavy armors, and clipping with feet when running. There is nothing I can do about the feet clipping, I do not want to rig the cloaks to a characters feet. Please do not ask me to do that, or ask me about shorting the longer cloaks this is how I wanted the current cloaks to be.

==========   
Conflicts
========== 

This mod makes use of the unused slots 46 (cloaks), 45 (scarves/wraps not yet in game). Any mod that uses those slots will conflict, if this happens please ask (nicely) the mod maker to consider using the Suggested Use of Additional Nodes.

http://www.creationkit.com/Biped_Object

Mods that edit the same level lists and outfits will conflict, which ever mod is in the later slot will win. Nothing major will happen to your game, other then not seeing some of the items show up in game. I HIGHLY suggest (but it is not required) you use Wrye Bash to create a Bash Patch to help make level lists work together.
