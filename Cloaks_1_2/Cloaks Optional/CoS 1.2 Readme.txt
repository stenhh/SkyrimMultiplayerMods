Use only ONE Cloaks.esp. 

Deactive Cloaks.esp and replace it with just ONE of these two optional files.

Cloaks - No Imperial - This is as the original file, but removes cloaks from Imperial NPCs to make compatible with the armours created by Prometheus. 

Cloaks - Player Only - Cloaks are hand-placed in the world and craftable, but no NPCs will wear them. They are unique to the player only.
